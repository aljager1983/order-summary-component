## Acknowledgments

The courses I have undergone in Udemy with Dr. Angela is helping me a lot. Had couple of notes during that bootcamp and I'm now they are helping a lot since I can't remember most of the syntaxes.

Additionally, I got some solution in stackoverflow (cant remember the thread though) for the deselect funcitonality.
